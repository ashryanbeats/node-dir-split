# Node Dir Split
This Node app will split the contents of a folder with many files into folders based on date.

## Dependencies
- fs
- bluebird

## Assets
There are a few sample photos available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y0diwg5x42fckgj/AAB9Rfp0O2sDzCXzNc6TJnz8a?dl=0). These folders can live anywhere on the local machine. Thebatch and destination folders do not necessarily need to be in the same parent folder.
